Collection of R notebooks employed for generating figures for the manuscript:
"Genetic Association of Ribosomal DNA Copy Number with Hematological 
Profiles and Renal Function in the UK Biobank"

Files 0.1 to 0.4 are preliminary, focused on the creation of the data 
structures necessary for the rest of the analysis.

Files F1 to F4 include the code necessary for the generation of the main
figures in the manuscript, as well as some of their most closely-related
supplementary figures.

File SF details the generation of the remaining supplementary figures.
