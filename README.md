# Scripts employed to analyse rDNA CN associations in the UK Biobank

Collection of R notebooks employed for generating figures for the manuscript:
"Genetic Association of Ribosomal DNA Copy Number with Hematological 
Profiles and Renal Function in the UK Biobank"

These scripts are included in the scripts_figures folder

Files 0.1 to 0.4 are preliminary, focused on the creation of the data 
structures necessary for the rest of the analysis.

Files F1 to F4 include the code necessary for the generation of the main
figures in the manuscript, as well as some of their most closely-related
supplementary figures.

File SF details the generation of the remaining supplementary figures.

The folder rdna_reference includes a FASTA file for the looped rDNA reference
employed to calculate total CN values from the 1000 genomes data.

The folder scripts_rap includes local and remote scripts exemplifying the
retrieval of reads from rDNA analogues on the UK Biobank
